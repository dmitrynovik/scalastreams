   * length: the block positions with the shortest paths (length of

   * 
   * The parameter `explored` is a set of block positions that have
   * been visited before, on the path to any of the blocks in the

   * been explored before, that position should not be included a
   * second time to avoid cycles.

   * The resulting stream should be sorted by ascending path length,
   * i.e. the block positions that can be reached with the fewest
   * amount of moves should appear first in the stream.

   * Note: the solution should not look at or compare the lengths
   * of different paths - the implementation should naturally
   * construct the correctly sorted stream.
